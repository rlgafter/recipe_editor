  "instructions": "1. Bring a large pot of water and 2 tablespoons (18 g) kosher salt to a boil over high heat.\r\n2. Add kale and cook, stirring occasionally, until vibrant green and tender, 6 to 7 minutes.\r\n3. Using tongs or a spider strainer, transfer kale to a rimmed baking sheet, and let cool until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.\r\n4. Working in batches, wrap kale in a clean kitchen towel, and squeeze to remove excess liquid.\r\n5. Coarsely chop kale and set aside.\r\n\r\n6. While kale cools, heat oil in a medium saucepan or high-sided skillet over medium heat.\r\n7. Add shallot and cook, stirring often, until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.\r\n8. Add cream and bring to a simmer over medium heat, about 1 minute.\r\n9. Cook, stirring frequently, until cream is thickened and reduced by about half, 8 to 10 minutes.\r\n10. Reduce heat to low.\r\n11. Add butter, garlic, and remaining 1 1/4 teaspoons (about 4 g) kosher salt.\r\n12. Cook, stirring constantly, until butter is melted.\r\n13. Add cream cheese and Parmesan.\r\n14. Whisk until combined, about 2 minutes.\r\n15. Stir in kale and cook, stirring occasionally, until warmed through and evenly coated in cream mixture, about 2 minutes.\r\n16. If needed, gradually add up to 1/4 cup water to loosen mixture to desired consistency.\r\n17. Remove from heat, and serve immediately.",
  "notes": "Creamed kale can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Gently reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave, adding a little cream as needed to achieve the proper consistency.",
