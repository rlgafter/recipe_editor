## 📝 **Pull Request Details**

### **Title**
```
feat: implement user types and permission system
```

### **Description**
```markdown
## 🎯 Overview
This PR implements a comprehensive user types and permission system, replacing the simple boolean `is_admin` flag with a flexible role-based access control (RBAC) system.

## ✨ Key Features

### **User Types System**
- **Unvalidated**: Basic users with limited access (default for new registrations)
- **Validated**: Confirmed users who can create and manage their own recipes
- **Share Recipes**: Users who can create recipes and share them publicly
- **Admin**: Full system access with ability to manage all users and content

### **Granular Permissions**
- `can_view_recipes`: View recipe content
- `can_create_recipes`: Create new recipes
- `can_edit_all_recipes`: Edit any recipe (admin only)
- `can_delete_all_recipes`: Delete any recipe (admin only)
- `can_manage_users`: Manage user accounts and types
- `can_manage_system`: System administration
- `can_share_recipes`: Share recipes publicly

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **Database Models** (`db_models.py`)
- ✅ Added `UserType` model with permission flags
- ✅ Enhanced `User` model with `user_type_id` foreign key
- ✅ Added permission checking methods

### **Storage Layer** (`mysql_storage.py`)
- ✅ Enhanced `get_recipe()` with user type validation
- ✅ Added permission checks in `save_recipe()` and `delete_recipe()`
- ✅ Improved error handling with descriptive messages

### **Authentication** (`auth.py`)
- ✅ Updated `create_user()` to support user types
- ✅ Enhanced user creation with type assignment

### **Admin Management**
- ✅ User type management functionality
- ✅ Bulk user type changes
- ✅ User type statistics and reporting

## 🔒 Security Improvements

### **Before (Simple Boolean)**
- ❌ Only admin/non-admin distinction
- ❌ No granular permissions
- ❌ All authenticated users could create/edit recipes

### **After (Role-Based System)**
- ✅ Granular permission system
- ✅ User type-based access control
- ✅ Permission validation at storage layer
- ✅ Admin-only sensitive operations

## 🚀 Migration

- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Existing `is_admin` field maintained
- ✅ **Auto-Migration**: Existing users automatically assigned appropriate types
- ✅ **Zero Downtime**: No breaking changes to existing functionality

## 📊 User Type Hierarchy

| User Type | View | Create | Edit Own | Edit All | Delete Own | Delete All | Manage Users |
|-----------|------|--------|----------|----------|------------|------------|--------------|
| **Unvalidated** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Validated** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Share Recipes** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
