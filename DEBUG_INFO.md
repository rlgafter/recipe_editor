# Unicode Fraction Conversion - Debug Information

## What Was Added

### 1. Unicode Fraction Conversion Function
The app now automatically converts unicode fraction characters (like ½, ¼, ¾) to ASCII equivalents (1/2, 1/4, 3/4).

### 2. Supported Conversions

**Simple Unicode Fractions:**
- ½ → 1/2
- ¼ → 1/4
- ¾ → 3/4
- ⅓ → 1/3
- ⅔ → 2/3
- ⅕ → 1/5
- ⅙ → 1/6
- ⅛ → 1/8
- And many more...

**Mixed Unicode Fractions:**
- 1½ → 1 1/2
- 2¼ → 2 1/4
- 3¾ → 3 3/4

**Spacing Issues (also fixed):**
- 1 1 /2 → 1 1/2
- 1 /2 → 1/2
- 1/ 2 → 1/2
- 1  1/2 → 1 1/2

### 3. Debug Logging

When you submit a recipe, you'll see detailed debug messages in `logs/app.log`:

```
[INGREDIENT 0] Raw amount: '½'
[UNICODE DEBUG] Converted simple fraction: '½' -> '1/2'
[AMOUNT CONVERSION] '½' -> '1/2'
[INGREDIENT 0] Converted amount: '1/2'
```

or for mixed fractions:

```
[INGREDIENT 1] Raw amount: '1½'
[UNICODE DEBUG] Converted mixed fraction: '1½' -> '1 1/2'
[AMOUNT CONVERSION] '1½' -> '1 1/2'
[INGREDIENT 1] Converted amount: '1 1/2'
```

### 4. Testing Results

All test cases passed:
- ✓ Simple unicode fractions (½, ¼, ¾)
- ✓ Mixed unicode fractions (1½, 2¼)
- ✓ Spacing issues (1 1 /2, 1 /2)
- ✓ All converted amounts pass validation
- ✓ Regular amounts (1, 1.5, 1/2) still work

## Next Steps

1. Try importing your recipe again (the one with unicode fractions)
2. Submit the form
3. Check `logs/app.log` to see the debug output showing conversions
4. The recipe should now save successfully!

## What to Look For

In the logs, you'll see lines like:
- `[INGREDIENT X] Raw amount: '...'` - Shows what was submitted
- `[UNICODE DEBUG] Converted ...` - Shows when a unicode fraction is detected
- `[AMOUNT CONVERSION] '...' -> '...'` - Summary of any conversion
- `[INGREDIENT X] Converted amount: '...'` - Final converted amount

If a conversion happens, you'll see INFO level messages.
Debug level messages show even more detail.
